He lives in Yuma Arizona, and at the time he had started a Drone Flying Club in the desert for \"Snowbirds\" traveling to Arizona from Canada to escape the cold winter. This club had given him a sense of purpose, which was to create a place for people who love adventure and community to meet, drink cold beers, eat some pizza, and act like a child again. On one of his early morning walks he noticed something shiny sitting on a ranch, surrounded by flowers, water, and horses. My dad walked up to the structure and noticed it was a 1959 vintage Streamline RV. Everything was original and PINK! Pink stove, pink shower and pink bed layouts. It didn't have much more to it, but my Dad could always see potential in one man's trash. He knocked on the RV owners' door and asked to buy the Streamline – the owner quickly said, \"No. This is a gem and I've owned it for 50 years.\" Respectfully my father left, but he thought about that Streamline RV on every morning walk for the next 2 years."),Object(n.h)("p",null,'One day the RV owner happened to be outside and noticed my dad walking by.

The daily work of shining Pinky (imagine wax on wax off from Karate Kid)  gave my dad new purpose and he was really starting to feel his anxiety under control. This new hobby, sense of purpose, creative outlet, and routine had become something my dad needed and once Pinky was finished,  we invested and started collecting two, three, and then four trailers... Always vintage, always turning one person's trash into another person's treasure.

We shared our vision of creating a space that will help people distract themselves from the pandemic while also providing  a blank canvas for self expression and a way to connect back to their free, happy, and lively side.
